#Final Project:

Running make test runs the tests

To use the program launch the script pythonLaunch.sh. The code runs, by defaul, with the argon_108 example.

Profiling and numerical results can be found in the respective folders.

By default make runs with optimizing flags and openmp, which can be disabled.

WARNING: the python script runs with python3, to make it run with python 2 remove .encode() from the c_char_p type.
